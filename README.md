# Members-Only

Members Only is an exclusive clubhouse where anyone can come and see the messages but only logged-in users can write new messages. To see who created the message and when users have to get the membership by entering a SECRET code. Users can check their membership status in the navigation menu. There's also an admin who can see all the messages with author, date, and time, and can also delete the messages.

I created this project mainly to practice full-stack development with a focus on authentication and user permissions management.
